# Ages Hard Logic Strategy Guide

This document details tricks and obscurities that are in Ages hard logic.
See
[ages_notes.md.md](https://github.com/jangler/oracles-randomizer/blob/doc/ages_notes.md)
for a list of things that are out of logic even in hard.

## General

- Use mystery seeds to light torches (1 in 4 chance of success). This is only
  in logic for rooms with no more than 2 torches.
- Get scent seeds from the plants in D3.
- Get bombs from Head Thwomp or Goron Shooting Gallery (200-299 points).
- Get a random potion from Maple instead of buying one from Syrup.
- Use bomb boosts to increase jump distance. Drop a bomb near the gap you're
  jumping, move slightly closer to the gap, and jump in the desired direction
  as the bomb explodes and hits you. Buffering the simultaneous jump +
  directional input by holding the relevant buttons while closing a menu makes
  the trick easier.

  I think the only relevant strictly horizontal or vertical bomb jump is across
  the water channels in past Rolling Ridge Base.

  Specific multi-directional bomb jumps are detailed later in this document,
  with video examples.

## Overworld Present

- RNG manip 100-rupee drops using the shovel, for infinite rupees in logic.
  Hard reset, mash through the title screen (it rolls RNG every frame), make 7
  screen transitions, and dig until the 100-rupee drop.

- Hit the switch in the cave under Tingle using a bomb/seed jump + boomerang.

- Reach the Crescent Island seed tree by visiting the map tile underwater, then
  warping to it with gale seeds. [[Video]](https://streamable.com/4bwyq)

## Overworld Past

- Patch swordless: push into a corner until all beetles are stacked together,
  then use shield, shovel, scent seeds, switch hook, or boomerang.

- Enter D6 past and cross the main waterway in Rolling Ridge Base by jumping
  into and out of the waterfall. Entering from either direction and exiting to
  the left only require a bomb jump, but exiting to the right requires pegasus
  seeds. [[Video]](https://streamable.com/sk6r3)
- Guard skip: Enter Ambi's palace by using pegasus seeds, dropping a scent seed
  on the ground to alert the guards at the entrance, waiting a moment, then
  running past them. Some people use a sword slash to time the duration of the
  wait. [[Video]](https://streamable.com/68dd7)
- Use a bomb+seed jump to reach the final book in the library trial without
  using the Book of Seals. [[Video]](https://streamable.com/jkv19)

## Dungeons

- Reach the item on a "shelf" in the D2 sidescroller by placing a block with
  the cane, riding the Thwomp, and using seeds or a bomb boost to cross the
  gap. [[Video (seed)]](https://streamable.com/t88r7)

- Clip through a shutter door in D2 by standing on the button that opens the
  door, pushing a Moblin into the doorway, and switching with the Moblin. You
  need to screen transition immediately after landing; otherwise you'll be
  treated as if falling into a pit. [[Video]](https://streamable.com/jqquv)
- Break the northwest crystal in D3 using the switch hook.

- Hit the lever for the vanilla D3 boss key chest using a spin slash through
  the wall. [[Video]](https://streamable.com/glehv)
- Hit levers for the bridges in D3 by:
	1. Using boomerang + seeds or feather in the first room.
	2. Using a bush + bracelet + toss ring + seeds or feather + a pot in the
	   first room.
	3. Using feather + sword + switch hook in the second room.
	4. Using feather + sword + a pot + bracelet in the second room.
	5. Using seeds/bombs + feather + ember/scent/mystery seeds from satchel in
	   the second room.

- Get two chests in D4 by hitting switches with feather + boomerang instead of
  seed shooter. [[Video]](https://streamable.com/2behr)
- Skip switch hook in D4 by taking the miniboss portal, bomb jumping to the
  bridge from the first minecart track, using cane to press the button
  downstairs, and breaking the pot using noble sword.
- Hit two switches in D5 from a distance by throwing pots. The second throw
  requires the toss ring, plus feather (+ seeds?) to cross the next barrier.

- Hit the second switch in D5 (from above video) using ember/scent/mystery
  seeds + satchel, using feather and cane to clip through the red pegs.

- Hit the three eye statues in D5 by using pegasus seeds, feather, and
  mystery seeds from satchel. [[Video]](https://streamable.com/hbyt6)
- Hit the switch in D5 before the two-statue puzzle using bomb jump + satchel +
  ember/scent/mystery seeds.
- Cross the bridge in D5 with seed + feather jumps, or by RNG manipulating the
  Darknut across the bridge using sword, then switch hooking it. The last two
  sword slashes before transitioning to the bridge room should be high pitch,
  then mid pitch. [[Video]](https://streamable.com/guma6)
- Walk diagonally across the corners of pits in the D6 present cube puzzle. [No
  video.]

## Not in logic because you could softlock but still cool

- Pass through the rock on the west side of Lynna City by switching with the
  Octorok. Clipping slightly into the fence tiles makes it slightly easier,
  using scent seeds to attract the Octorok makes it faster.
